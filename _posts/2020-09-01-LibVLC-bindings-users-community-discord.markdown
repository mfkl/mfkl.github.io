LibVLC is a crossplatform, portable, C library which works across most mobile and desktop platforms. Since it is written in C, there are many community language bindings surfacing the LibVLC APIs in other programming languages and ecosystems.

## By VideoLAN
- [libvlcpp](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libvlcpp) with C++.
> Notably used by the [medialibrary](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/medialibrary). 
- [vlckit](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit) for Apple platforms using Objective-C/Swift.
> Notably used by [VLC for iOS/tvOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-for-mobile/id650377962). 
- [libvlcjni](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-android) for Android platforms integrating with JNI using Java/Kotlin.
> Notably used by [VLC for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc). 
- [libvlcsharp](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp) for all desktop and mobile platforms using C#/F# with .NET.

## By the community
- [vlcj](https://github.com/caprica/vlcj) for Desktop plaforms using Java.
> Currently used by over 600 OSS projects on GitHub.
- [python-vlc](https://github.com/oaubert/python-vlc) for Desktop platforms using Python.
> Very mature (9 years old).
- [vlc-rs](https://github.com/garkimasera/vlc-rs) A relatively new LibVLC binding for Rust users.
- [libvlc-go](https://github.com/adrg/libvlc-go) A Go binding for LibVLC.

##### Feel free to contact me to add your own binding to this post.

So if you are maintaining a LibVLC binding and/or using LibVLC in your app, [join our LibVLC community discord server](https://discord.gg/3h3K3JF)!

Just ask a moderator to create a channel for your ecosystem if that has not been done already.

## Why Discord?

There are many ways to get in touch with the VideoLAN community, such as the [forum](https://forum.videolan.org/), the [developer mailing list](https://mailman.videolan.org/listinfo/vlc-devel), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/libvlc) or even [IRC](https://wiki.videolan.org/Contact_VideoLAN/#IRC). That last one is mostly aimed at core VLC developers though, which is why a space for LibVLC _consumers_ and bindings maintainers would be a great addition.

With libvlcsharp, we had been using Gitter but due to various bugs and limitations we decided to move to Discord a while ago. We are very happy with the change so far.

We are now around 100 in the LibVLC discord and opening up to LibVLC users and other bindings for **all** programming languages!

## Why join?

Here are some of the value you could get by joining up:

### If you're a LibVLC binding user
- Learn about various community projects,
- Get help to troubleshoot problems from volunteers,
- Engage with the community to start contributing to OSS LibVLC bindings,
- Just hangout!

### If you're a LibVLC binding maintainer
- Learn from other LibVLC binding maintainers with similar native interop challenges to yours,
- Help to align LibVLC APIs across multiple programming languages and ecosystems,
- Get help or advice with code and docs,
- Have a community that can help assist your users,
- Share your experience and findings maintaining a LibVLC binding.

We hope to [see you there](https://discord.gg/3h3K3JF)!
