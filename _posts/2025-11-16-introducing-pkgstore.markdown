I just launched [pkgstore.io](https://pkgstore.io), and I want to tell you why. 🎉

## The Discovery Problem 🔎

The .NET ecosystem has hundreds of high-quality commercial packages: Uno Platform, Avalonia, Blazorise, Iron Software,
Hangfire, and many more you've probably never heard of.

But where do you find them?

NuGet.org lists everything, but it doesn't distinguish between a weekend hobby project and a business-backed library with
professional support. Google searches surface scattered blog posts and outdated comparisons. You find packages by accident,
word-of-mouth, or because you already know the big vendors.

**For developers:** Discovery is fragmented and inefficient.

**For publishers:** You've built a quality library, maybe proprietary, maybe open-source with commercial licensing, but how do
developers find you?

**For companies:** When you need guarantees around support, security updates, maintenance, and SLAs, how do you discover which
packages offer that?

## Sustainability and Support 🛡️

Here's something important: **not every project can or should go commercial, and that's completely fine.**

Open-source community projects are the backbone of the .NET ecosystem. Many libraries thrive without a business model,
maintained by passionate developers and communities.

> But let's be honest: for niche, specialized, large, or complex software, donations rarely work for long-term sustainability of open source projects.

If you're building a library that needs consistent maintenance, security updates, professional support, or compliance
guarantees, you need a real business model:

- 💼 Commercial proprietary software (licensing, seats, tiers)
- 🤝 Open-source with paid support/consulting
- ⚡ Open-core and freemium models
- 📋 Dual licensing
- ✨ Premium builds and features

For companies evaluating packages, commercial backing often means:
- Paid support options
- Regular security updates
- Long-term maintenance commitments
- Legal protection and licensing clarity
- Professional documentation and onboarding

## What I built 🚀

**pkgstore.io is a curated, searchable directory of commercially-backed .NET packages.**

Phase 1 (live now):
- ✅ **16 publishers already listed** (Uno Platform, Avalonia, Blazorise, Iron Software, Hangfire, and more)
- Clean, searchable directory
- Direct links to packages, documentation, and pricing
- Free listing for all publishers
- Clear inclusion criteria (support, pricing, maintenance signals)

Whether you're an enterprise vendor or an indie developer, if you have a sustainable business model around your .NET package,
you belong here.

## Get Started 👉

- 🔎 Developers: Browse the directory → https://pkgstore.io
- 📰 Publishers: Get listed → sign up to the newsletter on https://pkgstore.io

## What's Coming 🔔

This directory is just phase one.

I'm building pkgstore.io to become the home for commercial .NET packages, with features that will fundamentally change how
publishers reach developers and how developers discover tools.

But I wanted to start with something useful *today*. Get feedback. Learn what the community actually needs. Then build what
matters.

More announcements coming soon. 👀
