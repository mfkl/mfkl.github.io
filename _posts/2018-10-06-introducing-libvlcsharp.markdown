LibVLCSharp are .NET/Mono bindings for `libvlc`, the multimedia framework powering the VLC applications.

We support all .NET runtimes (Xamarin/Mono, .NET Core and .NET Framework) on most platfoms by targeting .NET Standard 2.0.

`libvlc` is *modularized* into [hundreds of plugins](https://github.com/mfkl/libvlc-nuget/blob/master/tree.md), which may be loaded at runtime. This architecture provides great flexibility to developers (both VLC devs and devs consuming the library). The unified, complete and (somewhat) high level `libvlc` C API allows a wide range of operations, such as:

- Network browsing for distant filesystems (SMB, FTP, SFTP, NFS...).
- HDMI passthrough for Audio HD codecs, like E-AC3, TrueHD or DTS-HD.
- Stream to distant renderers, like Chromecast.
- 360 video and 3D audio playback with viewpoint change.
- Support for Ambisonics audio and more than 8 audio channels.
- Subtitles size modification live.
- Hardware decoding and display on all platforms.
- DVD playback and menu navigation.

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Loading the native libvlc library
        Core.Initialize();

        using (var libVLC = new LibVLC())
        using (var mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer(libVLC))
        {
            var media = new Media(libVLC, 
                                "http://www.quirksmode.org/html5/videos/big_buck_bunny.mp4", 
                                Media.FromType.FromLocation)
            mediaPlayer.Play(media);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

LibVLCSharp aims to always support the latest `libvlc` major version (currently version 3).

We are distributing packages (native and managed) through [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/videolan).

We use [GitLab](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp) and [GitHub](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp).
