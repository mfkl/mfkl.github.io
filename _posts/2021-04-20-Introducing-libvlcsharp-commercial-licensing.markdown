Today we are introducing a **Commercial License** for LibVLCSharp, the .NET SDK for the multimedia and cross-platform LibVLC framework.

# OSS Sustainability

[I have written before](https://mfkl.github.io/2020/10/25/OSS-sutainability.html) on the topic of open-source sustainability. This is a subject I find personally very interesting and solutions to these problems can prove tricky.

Donations just do not work. And for developer tools, another approach seems particularly fitting: **Dual licensing**.

# Dual licensing

LibVLCSharp (and LibVLC) will remain licensed under the LGPL2.1 license. However, a new Commercial License is now available for commercial .NET users.

This is very much like the approach our friends at [Six Labors](https://sixlabors.com/pricing/), makers of [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp)<sup>1</sup>, have chosen, and I believe it strikes a good balance between keeping an open and accessible license for individual developers, and inviting companies who critically rely on open-source projects to contribute financially.

# Pricing

Our initial pricing is a single plan set at **99$/year/developer**<sup>2</sup>. This is very competitive pricing considering the years of work that has already been put in LibVLCSharp (not to mention LibVLC), and the additional guarantees you will get for that small price:

- priority support (no SLA),
- priority bug fixes, feature requests and documentation improvements,
- continuous update of the NuGet packages.

If your company builds commercial products using [LibVLCSharp](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp), we strongly encourage you to [purchase](https://videolabs.io/solutions/libvlcsharp/) one (or several) LibVLCSharp Commercial Licenses. Doing so will help support the project's long term viability.

<sup>1</sup> Btw, we have a nice and short [LibVLCSharp/ImageSharp code sample](https://code.videolan.org/mfkl/libvlcsharp-samples/-/blob/master/PreviewThumbnailExtractor/Program.cs)!
