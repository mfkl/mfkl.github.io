On the psychology of OSS: passion, burnout and (im)balance.
business, ethics, relationship with technology
Opensource dynamics

The Opensource world is a very diverse place. That's one of the reasons I enjoy it. You get to interact with people from anywhere in the world, and read very different code approaches. Location or timezone don't really matter.

// It can be a very rich experience, both in terms of social aspect as well as technical aspect.

The topic of OSS sustainability has been talked about more and more in the past few years. So many widely used libraries and programs are understaffed and underfunded, yet many companies ignore this fact or just do not care.

Examples:

Multiple symptoms are well identified in these posts but solutions to the root causes are harder to come around. There are multifaceted, hard, problem. 

It is not a _new_ problem, but with opensource changing and being used as a marketing tool, notably by big tech, as OSS usage grew, the scope of the problems did as well.

I have been thinking about these things quite a bit in the past few weeks, notably while [writing my book](https://www.libvlcsharpthebook.com/preview) which has a part dedicated to OSS, and wanted to write some things down in a dedicated blogpost. I am hoping to suggest some possible solutions to various well identified problems. No idea if they would actually work in practice.

People (that includes developers) have been accustomed to not having to **pay with money** for a lot stuff online... Free browser. Free email account. Free search engine. Free code. Free IDE. Free support. Free maintenance. It's all good!

Forget all you know about programming, building software and the tech industry for a second.

TL;DR: People, both developers and executives, have expectations and beliefs about software (in general). Lack of education, no experience in OSS.

> If every single developer was made to become a maintainer of any midly/highly-sucessful OSS project for 6 months or a year, say like an OSS service, I believe there would be much more empathy and consideration in the OSS community at large.

I'm not actually saying this military-style option would be A Good Thing, just making a point. _Not everyone is interested in becoming an opensource maintainer either, and that is very much OK_. But it's pretty safe to say that most if not all developers use and need OSS.



There are good people and assholes everywhere. That you can't fix.

Say you're now building a real estate business. Your core business is real estate. Except you need a website, 

twitter, github, SO, folks
### OSS
how it has changed.

### (Im)balance:
- The imbalance is real and it is invisible, in a way, for most people. If you are on Twitter and use GitHub, your experience is not representative of the majority of developers in the world.

Human flaws apply. You will likely feel differently if a bomb explods on the other side of the world, and if one explods in your street.

I believe that tech leads, executives and people in decision-making positions will only act  to 
They might care if they were aware, they might not. I don't ask myself that question, I ask how can we make them aware?



### Possible solution

### Burnout:

### Possible solution

- try to suggest new solutions:"
* Asking the occasional coder to pay isn't really working as far as I can see. Companies should be the one paying.
* There is a ton of SME and larger companies for which Tech isn't their main business yet they still have a tech department. That company's management team, including sometimes their tech team's lead, They're not on twitter, they don't use github. Yet they consume a lot of OSS. They don't actually know how critical OSS is for their operations and products developement.

There is an education work to do here.

They don't know how critical OSS is for THEIR business. Teach them.
They don't know how many libs are maintained by one or two maintainer, and the risk of burn out is high. Maintainers need more help, not more tickets. Teach them OSS sustainability today's challenges.
I think many business owners never even thought of giving (skills, time, money, hardware) to OSS maintainers. What if you took 10.000 random companies right now and made them examine their graph of dependencies and showed them how many these libraries's maintainers need help? That'd be specific enough.

How do you do that?

Once the tech team is on your side, you need to make the management team UNDERSTAND.

Balance needs to reset. Companies don't realize the current imbalance. They need to taught about it.

OSS, when a passion project becomes a nightmare. AS-IS
Need to teach AS-IS to both maintainers and non-maintainers. Where? Where people learn coding? 
dev bootcamps,
engineering schools,
online bootcamp thingy.

Videolan/videolabs/netflix/youtube example.

OSS has changed a lot in the past 20 years. Big Tech understood it appeals to the average programmer for various reasons (TODO: name of a few) and uses that as a very successful marketing strategy.

Raise awareness. what? why? how? when?

Ok you've convinced the guy. Now what? He can make a donation. I'm not a lawyer, should be pretty simple for the accountant to record a donation. Having an invoice could be a showstopper? Don't think so.


Maintainer burn out is real. There should be a place that educates maintainer on what providing software AS-IS means. Burn out help/advice/psychology center, and safe space with other maintainers who experienced or are experiencing burn out.

several issues are linked 

OSS Intro.
list several identified problems
    foreach of those problems, list some causes/explanations, and possible solutions.

- PROBLEM: Making a living from donations doesn't work.

SOLUTION: Unless you're really famous or something, and probably a white priviledged male, chances of it happening are rather low (though it does happen!). We've seen this with videolan. In many cases, it doesn't matter how many millions of users you have, you can't rely on donations only to hope to pay a team of maintainers a salary every month. 
Companies should be targetted for donations in priority, not the occasional hacker. I mean, sure that's great, but that's not sustainable or a reliable way or fair. Companies.

- PROBLEM: maintainers burn out

* SOLUTION: Encourage/educate better hygiene with regard to technology. Github (because that's the popular tool of the moment, I don't endorse them) is not doing a great job here, you get auto-subbed to issues quite often by default and notification management is poor. https://www.humanetech.com/take-control

* SOLUTION: Software is provided as-is could be written somewhere when someone opens an issue

* SOLUTION: Provide a space for mentorship to happen. Yes that's more work for maintainers, but not only maintainer of a specific project can mentor junior. After some experience, I believe you learn lessons than can apply to most projects. Then plenty of developers could help mentor, not just busy maintainers.

* SOLUTION: Provide a space for "passing the torch". 
There should be a place that facilitates mentoring and giving ownership of your project to someone else. People's need change, work requirements and dependencies change. Time availability change. Interests evolve. There should be systems in place so that maintainers can give over their code (and deployment keys) to trusted new members, if they choose to. 

- PROBLEM: Millions of companies in the world critically rely on understaffed and underfunded (so, that's risky and unethical) opensource software without contributing a dime.

* SOLUTION: uh... educate people. How?
** Educate the tech side, developers, leads, architects, CTOs...
> Where to educate them: where people learn to code? C.S degrees, universities, The Internet, StackOverflow, GitHub, whatever. these places, and others, have a responsibility, in a way, to do this given they are the centerpoint for devs both junior and senior, to go to. Twitter is nice and all, but don't believe that your twitter bubble is in _any_ way representative of the dozens (hundreds?) of millions of developers in world today. It's not.

> Why: they need to advocate for this inside the company. They know their software dependencies (most of the time) and which libraries they could donate, which they rely on critically, which they are thankful for, that does the heavy lifting for them, which they dont have to maintain themselves, so they can focus on other things. Tech people are currently in a strong position for negociation. Make opensource a topic (a condition?) in your next hiring interview (whether you are hiring or looking for a job).

** Educate non tech side. CEOs, CFOs and other people with company writing-check abilities. The discourse/dialog needs to be different here, because these people are not necessarily techies, so.
- Make clear what are the operational risk, and impacts, 
- make clear of the imbalance of the current state, and ethics.
- show what happens to their business if a low-critical dependency gets abandoned by their maintainer. show what happens to their business if a middle/high critical dependency gets abandoned by their maintainer.
- Show how giving back will help alleviate the risks of that happening (project ownership transfer system, developer care and health).
- Operational ideas for action: give money, give time, give skills, give code, give documentation, give hardware, give recognition, hire the maintainers.
