* Asking the occasional coder to pay isn't really working as far as I can see. Companies should be the one paying.
* There is a ton of SME and larger companies for which Tech isn't their main business yet they still have a tech department. That company's management team, including sometimes their tech team's lead, They're not on twitter, they don't use github. Yet they consume a lot of OSS. They don't actually know how critical OSS is for their operations and products developement.

There is an education work to do here.

They don't know how critical OSS is for THEIR business. Teach them.
They don't know how many libs are maintained by one or two maintainer, and the risk of burn out is high. Maintainers need more help, not more tickets. Teach them OSS sustainability today's challenges.
I think many business owners never even thought of giving (skills, time, money, hardware) to OSS maintainers. What if you took 10.000 random companies right now and made them examine their graph of dependencies and showed them how many these libraries's maintainers need help? That'd be specific enough.

How do you do that?

Once the tech team is on your side, you need to make the management team UNDERSTAND.

Balance needs to reset. Companies don't realize the current imbalance. They need to taught about it.

OSS, when a passion project becomes a nightmare. AS-IS
Need to teach AS-IS to both maintainers and non-maintainers. Where? Where people learn coding? 
dev bootcamps,
engineering schools,
online bootcamp thingy.

Videolan/videolabs/netflix/youtube example.

OSS has changed a lot in the past 20 years. Big Tech understood it appeals to the average programmer for various reasons (TODO: name of a few) and uses that as a very successful marketing strategy.

Raise awareness. what? why? how? when?

Ok you've convinced the guy. Now what? He can make a donation. I'm not a lawyer, should be pretty simple for the accountant to record a donation. Having an invoice could be a showstopper? Don't think so.

There should be a place that facilitates mentoring and giving ownership of your project to someone else. People's need change, work requirements and dependencies change. Time availability change. Interests evolve. There should be systems in place so that maintainers can give over their code (and deployment keys) to trusted new members, if they choose to. 

Maintainer burn out is real. There should be a place that educates maintainer on what providing software AS-IS means. Burn out help/advice/psychology center, and safe space with other maintainers who experienced or are experiencing burn out.
