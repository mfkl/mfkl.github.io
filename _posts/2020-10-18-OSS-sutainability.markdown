On the psychology of OSS: passion, burnout and (im)balance.

The Opensource world is a very diverse place. That's one of the reasons I enjoy it. You get to interact with people from anywhere in the world, and read very different code approaches. Location or timezone don't really matter in opensource. It can be a very rich experience, both in terms of social aspect as well as technical aspect.

The topic of OSS sustainability has been talked about more and more in the past few years.

Examples:

- https://dev.to/erikras/open-source-sustainability-3pjf

Symptoms are well identified in these posts but solutions are harder to come around. It is a multifaceted,  hard, problem. It is not a _new_ problem, but with opensource changing and being used as a marketing tool, notably by big tech, as OSS usage grew, the scope of the problem did as well.

I have been thinking about these things quite a bit in the past few weeks, notably while [writing my book](), and wanted to put some things down. Though I don't claim to know the universal truth, I'm hoping to suggest some possible solutions.

People, that includes developers, are used to not having to pay for a lot stuff online. Free browser. Free email account. Free search engine. Free code. Free IDE. Free support. Free maintenance. It's all good!

Forget all you know about programming, building software and the tech industry for a second.

TL;DR: People, both developers and executives, have expectations and beliefs about software (in general). Lack of education, no experience in OSS.

> If every single developer was made to become a maintainer of any midly/highly-sucessful OSS project for 6 months or a year, say like an OSS service, I believe there would be much more empathy and consideration in the OSS community at large.

Not saying this military style option is the solution at all, just making a point. Not everyone is interested in becoming an opensource maintainer, and that's OK. But it's pretty safe to say that most if not all developers use and need OSS.



There are good people and assholes everywhere. That you can't fix.

Say you're now building a real estate business. Your core business is real estate. Except you need a website, 

twitter, github, SO, folks
### OSS
how it has changed.

### (Im)balance:
- The imbalance is real and it is invisible, in a way, for most people. If you are on Twitter and use GitHub, your experience is not representative of the majority of developers in the world.

Human flaws apply. You will likely feel differently if a bomb explods on the other side of the world, and if one explods in your street.

I believe that tech leads, executives and people in decision-making positions will only act  to 
They might care if they were aware, they might not. I don't ask myself that question, I ask how can we make them aware?

actions: give money, give time, give skills, give code, give documentation, give hardware, hire devs, give recognition.

### Possible solution

### Burnout:

### Possible solution

- try to suggest new solutions:"
* Asking the occasional coder to pay isn't really working as far as I can see. Companies should be the one paying.
* There is a ton of SME and larger companies for which Tech isn't their main business yet they still have a tech department. That company's management team, including sometimes their tech team's lead, They're not on twitter, they don't use github. Yet they consume a lot of OSS. They don't actually know how critical OSS is for their operations and products developement.

There is an education work to do here.

They don't know how critical OSS is for THEIR business. Teach them.
They don't know how many libs are maintained by one or two maintainer, and the risk of burn out is high. Maintainers need more help, not more tickets. Teach them OSS sustainability today's challenges.
I think many business owners never even thought of giving (skills, time, money, hardware) to OSS maintainers. What if you took 10.000 random companies right now and made them examine their graph of dependencies and showed them how many these libraries's maintainers need help? That'd be specific enough.

How do you do that?

Once the tech team is on your side, you need to make the management team UNDERSTAND.

Balance needs to reset. Companies don't realize the current imbalance. They need to taught about it.

OSS, when a passion project becomes a nightmare. AS-IS
Need to teach AS-IS to both maintainers and non-maintainers. Where? Where people learn coding? 
dev bootcamps,
engineering schools,
online bootcamp thingy.

Videolan/videolabs/netflix/youtube example.

OSS has changed a lot in the past 20 years. Big Tech understood it appeals to the average programmer for various reasons (TODO: name of a few) and uses that as a very successful marketing strategy.

Raise awareness. what? why? how? when?

Ok you've convinced the guy. Now what? He can make a donation. I'm not a lawyer, should be pretty simple for the accountant to record a donation. Having an invoice could be a showstopper? Don't think so.

There should be a place that facilitates mentoring and giving ownership of your project to someone else. People's need change, work requirements and dependencies change. Time availability change. Interests evolve. There should be systems in place so that maintainers can give over their code (and deployment keys) to trusted new members, if they choose to. 

Maintainer burn out is real. There should be a place that educates maintainer on what providing software AS-IS means. Burn out help/advice/psychology center, and safe space with other maintainers who experienced or are experiencing burn out.
